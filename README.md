## Notable Mods ***(WIP)***

this isn't to say that the mods in the pack that aren't on this list aren't important. these are just the mods that you will most likely notice while playing.


## Notable Changes ***(WIP)***

- Iron golem farms are no longer viable. *there are easier and more efficient ways to farm iron, gold, lapis, redstone and coal in this modpack*
- Creepers and the new mob "creepies" no longer destroy terrain upon exploding. instead, they spawn a few smaller creeper like mobs called "creepies". They are much easier to kill but can still hurt you with their smaller explosions.
